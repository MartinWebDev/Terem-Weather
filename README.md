# Assumptions
1. We can ignore the number of days data was recorded for (column 7) as there is only 1 record that is not blank or 1,
and including this would introduce a world of mental pain to factor in what I hereby dub "unaggregating" data 😜
2. We will also ignore column 8, quality of measurement, and assume all data to be accurate.
